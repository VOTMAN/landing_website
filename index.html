        <div>
            <h4>#1-Bloodborne</h4>
            <img class="img" src="./img/bloodborne.avif">
            <div class="stuff">I really don't care what others think and in fact what is true is that Bloodborne is the best souls games to exist. It's really got everything, some may not like the looks or aesthetic but its everything one could ask for in a souls game</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>#2-Dark Souls 3</h4>
            <img class="img" src="./img/darksouls3.webp">
            <h4>#2-Sekiro</h4>
            <img class="img" src="./img/sekiro.jpg">
            <div class="stuff">Look, i don't know which one i'd choose if i were given a choice. I would want both.The bosses in dark souls are second to non. But the combat in Sekiro is difficult but satisfying. I cannot pick between the two.</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>#3-Elden Ring</h4>
            <img class="img" src="./img/eldenring.jpeg">
            <div class="stuff">It'a a good game don't get me wrong, but it's lacking the charm that the previous rankings had. but didn't stop me from getting my first ever plat in it. It has the most replayability out of all the others</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>#4-Dark Souls</h4>
            <img class="img" src="./img/darksouls.jpg">
            <div class="stuff">The OG, can never forget the first time I beat it. This would have ranked 1st if it weren't for its age. You can tell where they cut some corners (The second half of the game) with this game but overall its the one I like the most</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>#5-Demon Souls</h4>
            <img class="img" src="./img/demonsouls.jpeg">
            <div class="stuff">Never played it but look good. Got a remake so couldn't be that bad. I have nothing more to say. I'm goona say it had some morally conflicting enemies which makes us think, are we are bad guys?</div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Dark Souls 2</h4>
            <img class="img" src="./img/darksouls2.jpeg">
            <div class="stuff">I saved this for last because it would be unfair for the other games if this was included. Ofcourse it the best in the series, just stating facts. Jokes aside, it's the first souls game i've played, its got good DLCs and the best lobby, Mejula.</div>
